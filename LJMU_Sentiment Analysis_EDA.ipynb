Comparing to Micromax, this phone has a better camera, good internal memory. The phone processor is pretty good. The display of the phone is very good as it has a 6&apos;inch display.. The battery backup is good. The front and the back camera is good.       The quality of the earphones are not that good.  The phone heats up if playing games for a long time.      ',\n",

I for one have a lot of data which makes the internal storage seem very less for the device. The Android version on the phone is also very outdated. The display quality is good and appreciable. Overall the phone is a good purchase for someone who does not have huge tasks to perform. Camera quality Display       Outdated android Less internal storage      ',\n",
